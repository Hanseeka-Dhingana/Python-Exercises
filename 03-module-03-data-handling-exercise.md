# Introduction to Data Handling
## Basic Questions   
### Data Types in Python
1. What will be the output of the following code?   
``` python
a = 10
print(type(a))
``` 
2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.     
3. How can you represent an integer in binary, octal, and hexadecimal formats? Provide examples.

5. Differentiate between int, float, and complex numeric data types in Python.   
6. Explain the concept of sequences in Python and give examples of sequence data types.   
7. Discuss the use of sets in Python and provide examples.
8. Explain the concept of type casting in Python.
9. What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in Python dictionaries?
10. What is the purpose of the None data type in Python?

4. What happens when you try to convert a complex number to an integer?  
5. What is the output of int(True) and int(False)?  
6. Can a string containing decimal values (e.g., "10.5") be converted using int()? Why or why not?
7. What is the output of bool(0), bool(10), and bool("")? Explain.

### Constants in Python

1.What are constants in Python, and how do they differ from regular variables?  
2. Why does Python not have built-in support for constants like some other programming languages?    
3. What naming conventions should be followed when defining constants in Python? Explain with examples.  
4. How does using uppercase letters for constants improve code readability and maintainability?   
5. Why should constants be defined at the top of a Python module or script?   
6. Explain the concept of immutability in the context of constants. How can developers enforce immutability in Python?    
7. How can constants help in avoiding the use of magic numbers in a Python program? Give an example.   
8. What are the advantages of using named constants instead of hard-coded values in a program?     
9. Why is it a best practice to add comments or docstrings to constants? Provide an example.    
10. What are the benefits of using a separate module for constants in larger projects?    
11. If Python does not enforce constant behavior, how can developers prevent accidental modification of constants?    
12. Describe a scenario where not using constants could lead to errors or confusion in a project.    
13. Can constants be defined inside functions in Python? If yes, explain with an example.   
14. What are some common use cases where constants are essential in Python programs?     
15. Explain how constants improve collaboration in a team-based development environment.    
16. How does defining constants help in debugging and modifying a program?     
17. In what situations might a developer choose to use constants instead of variables?    
18.  How does using constants help in adapting a program to future changes more efficiently?
