#### Question 5: **Display three string “Name”, “Is”, “James” as <code style="color: white;">Name\*\*Is\*\*James</code>**  
Use the print() function to format the given words in the mentioned format. Display the ** separator between each string.  
   

 *For example:*
  ``` Python     
        print('Name', 'Is', 'James')    
   ```    
 *Expected Output:*   
 ```text  
       Name**Is**James
 ```

<br>

---   
#### Question 10: **If-else**  
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

- If n is `odd, print Weird`

- If n is even and in the inclusive range of  `2 to 5, print Not Weird`
- If n is even and in the inclusive range of `6 to 20, print Weird`
- If n is even and greater than `20, print Not Weird`

#### Question 11: **Food Rating**  
In a five-star restaurant review system (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️), the stars typically represent the different levels of satisfaction.

But what does each of the stars mean?

Start by creating a rating variable and set it equal to a decimal number.

Make a rating system using an **`if/elif/else`** statement:

- rating greater than `4.5`, print `'Extraordinary'`
- rating greater than `4`, print `'Excellent'`
- rating greater than `3`, print `'Good'`
- rating greater than `2`, print `'Fair'`
- Everything else, print `'Poor'`

#### Question 12: **Snapple Facts**  
Snapple is a famous tea drink brand from Queens, New York. Each bottle cap comes with a silly fun fact.

Use the **`random module`** to create a number from 0 to 5.

Then use an **`if/elif/else`** statement to print out one of these six random Snapple facts:

0 - 'Flamingos turn pink from eating shrimp.'  
1 - 'The only food that doesn't spoil is honey.'  
2 - 'Shrimp can only swim backwards.'  
3 - 'A taste bud's life span is about 10 days.'

Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division. The second line should contain the result of float division.

No rounding or formatting is necessary.

#### Question 14: **Memory Address of Object**  
Create two variable and take input from user, check the memory address of both objects, and analyse it.   

<br>   

---
#### Question 15: **Properties and Functions of Objects**   
Write the program that inspect the properties and functions of different objects.    

<br>   

---   
#### Question 16: **Display Documentation**
